## Goodbye, Snapi CI :(

You may have heard the sad news that Thoughtworks is  shutting down their cloud-based CI/CD service, Snap CI. This is super sad for the industry but we know Thoughtworks will continue to do great work with their other products as well as with their excellent on-premise CI/CD service, GoCD.

So, to the Snap CI team and Thoughtworks team behind them, great job and good luck on your next efforts! To Snap CI customers and users, we’d love to help you keep your builds running and your code shipping.

## Simplicity, Flexibility and Support: How We Compare To Snap CI

Codeship and Snap CI solve the same problem and we offer a lot of the same features and value. Here’s a quick look at how we compare.

Just like Snap CI, we’re focused on providing everything you need for your CI/CD pipeline, as well as on making it as fast and simple as possible. We’re also focused on world-class support, something else us and our friends at Snap CI have in common.

- Repo driven workflows with branch-based deployments
- Configure your builds through a simple web UI or customized yml files
- Easy, turnkey deployment integrations or flexible, powerful build architectures
- Github, BitBucket and Gitlab support
- Repo status notifications, as well as Slack, Hipchat and custom webhook notifications
- Full support for all standard web and build languages
- Native Docker support

Our features are spread out between [Codeship Basic](https://codeship.com/features/basic), our super simple, super fast to set up product for more straightforward workflows and web technologies, and [Codeship Pro](https://codeship.com/features/pro), our Docker-driven product for building fully customized and flexible CI-CD environments in the cloud.

## How you get started

If you’re interested in getting started with Codeship Basic, [we’ve got a three minute video](https://codeship.com/features/basic) showing you just how simple it is to get started testing and deploying in just a few minutes. From there, you can create your account and get started!

If you’re interested in use Docker or a more customized build environment on Codeship Pro, we’ve got a [short demo of how to use the Docker and the Codeship Pro yml files](https://pages.codeship.com/demo/codeship-pro-short-demo) to define your environment and build your pipeline, and a [getting started guide](https://documentation.codeship.com/pro/getting-started/getting-started/) that will walk you through setting up a sample project. Just create your account and let us know if you need any help!
