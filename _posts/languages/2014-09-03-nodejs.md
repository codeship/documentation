We use **nvm** to manage different node versions. We read the node version you set in your **package.json** and install the appropriate one.

## Default Version
The default version when we can't find a setting in your package.json is `0.10.25`

## Set it in Setup commands
You can of course always set it directly through the setup commands by running

```shell
nvm install NODE_VERSION
nvm use NODE_VERSION
```

## Preinstalled versions
We install the latest versions for **0.8.x**, **0.9.x**, **0.10.x** and **0.11.x**, as well as the current version of **io.js**.

## io.js
If you want to use [io.js](https://iojs.org/) simply add the following step to your setup commands.

```shell
nvm use iojs
```

You can then either use the `node` or the `iojs` binary to run your applications.

## npm
You can use npm to install your dependencies. We set the `$PATH` to include the `node_modules/.bin` folder so all executables installed through npm can be run.

If you have a npm version specified in your `package.json` file, it won't get picked up by *nvm* automatically. Please include the following snippet in your setup steps to install the specified version.

```shell
npm install -g npm@`cat package.json | jq -r '.engines.npm'`
```

If you simply want to upgrade `npm` to the latest available version add the following command to your setup steps.

```shell
npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Caching globally installed dependencies

If you want to cache packages installed via the `-g` switch as well, please add the following command to your setup steps.

```shell
npm config set cache "${HOME}/cache/npm/"
```

*Note:* Do not run `npm test` to execute grunt tests. When a grunt test fails, it will return a non-zero exit code to npm. npm will ignore this and return a zero.

## Tools and Test frameworks
You can use all test frameworks or tools including karma, mocha, grunt or any other node based tool. Make sure you install the first through npm. Use the same commands you are using on your own system to start your tests, for example:

```shell
grunt test
```
