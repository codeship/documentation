You can transfer your project to another account by navigating to:

***Project Settings > General***

A user with appropriate permission for the target account needs to confirm the transfer if you do not have project creation rights in the target account. When confirming the transfer, the user can choose which of the current team members to keep and which to remove.

If you want to **bulk transfer projects**, please reach out to our support via [helpdesk.codeship.com](https://helpdesk.codeship.com).

<h2>Use Case Example</h2>
* You are using the Heroku addon and want to start using Codeship without it.
* You don't want to maintain a project anymore and want to transfer it to someone else.
