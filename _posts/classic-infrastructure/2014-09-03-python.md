We use **virtualenv** to manage python environments for you. We currently support Python `2.7.6`. Version `3.4.0` of Python is installed as well and available via the `python3` binary.

## Dependencies
You can use pip to install any dependencies, for example

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Python 3
As the virtual environment from `${HOME}/.virtualenv` is already activated and configured for use on the build VMs, if you want to switch to version 3, simply add the following commands to your _Setup Steps_.

```shell
virtualenv -p $(which python3) "${HOME}/cache/python3_env"
source "${HOME}/cache/python3_env/bin/activate"
```
