If you're looking to get started with Codeship Pro, we have some great resources that make for different entry points depending on your needs.

## Comprehensive Introduction Guide

[Read our five-part Getting Started guide]({% link _pro/quickstart/getting-started.md %}) if you'd like to spend a couple hours following along with a guide that walks you through the basics of working with Codeship Pro, writing your configuration files and explaining the system overall.

## Quickstart Example Repos

If you just want some starter configuration files that point out how Pro works most commonly for different languages, you can grab our quickstart repos:
